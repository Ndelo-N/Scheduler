- **Right Panel**: The calendar view showing the schedule
- **Bottom Panel**: Summary information and additional controls

---

## Loading Student Data

### Method 1: Load Sample Data (For Testing)
1. Click the **"Load sample"** button in the top header
2. This loads 5 test students with sample availability
3. Use this to practice before loading real student data

### Method 2: Import from CSV File
1. **Prepare your CSV file** with student information
2. Click **"Choose File"** next to the CSV import section
3. Select your CSV file from your computer
4. Click **"Import CSV"**
5. The system will process the data and show a success message

#### CSV File Format
Your CSV file should have these columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **id** | Student ID number | `1` |
| **name** | Full student name | `John Smith` |
| **weekly_max_hours** | Maximum hours per week | `18` |
| **contracted_monthly_hours** | Total hours for the month | `72` |
| **color** | Color code for the student | `#FFB3BA` |
| **avatar_url** | (Optional) URL to student's photo | `https://example.com/photo.jpg` |
| **availability** | Student's weekly schedule and unavailable dates | `{"weekly":[...],"unavailable_dates":[...]}` |

#### Student Avatars
- **Avatar URLs**: Include a link to the student's photo in the `avatar_url` column
- **Fallback**: If no avatar is provided, the system shows a colored dot
- **Display**: Avatars appear on student chips and in the "Add Student" modal
- **Format**: Use standard image URLs (JPG, PNG, etc.)

### Method 3: Add Students Manually
**Note**: Manual student entry has been removed to streamline the interface. Use CSV import for adding students, or modify the sample data as a starting point.

## Setting Up the Schedule

### Step 1: Select Month and Year
1. In the **"Year"** field, enter the year (e.g., 2025)
2. In the **"Month"** dropdown, select the month
3. The calendar will update to show the selected month

### Step 2: Configure Operational Hours
1. Go to the **"Operational Hours"** section
2. Set **Default start time** (usually 06:00)
3. Set **Default end time** (usually 19:00)

#### Adding Public Holidays
1. In the **"Public holidays"** text area, add holidays in this format:
   ```json
   [{"date":"2025-12-25","name":"Christmas Day"}]
   ```
2. Click **"Update operational hours"**

#### Adding Special Hours
1. For days with different hours (like early closing):
   - Select the **date**
   - Set **start time** and **end time**  
   - Add a **name** (like "Early Closing")
2. Click **"Add"**
3. Click **"Update operational hours"**

#### Adding Batch Holidays (School Breaks)
1. For extended breaks:
   - Select **start date** and **end date**
   - Add a **name** (like "Winter Break")
2. Click **"Add"**
3. Click **"Update operational hours"**

### Step 3: Set Up Assessment Periods
1. Go to **"Assessment Periods"** section
2. Click **"Add Assessment Period"**
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: Like "Midterm Exams"
   - **Start date** and **End date**
4. Click **"Add"**

> **üí° Assessment Period Logic**: During assessment periods, the scheduler disregards students' regular weekly availability and only applies test-specific rules (no work before tests, +1 hour after tests). This allows for more flexible scheduling during exam periods.

### Step 4: Configure Test Shifts
1. Go to **"Test Shifts"** section
2. For each test:
   - Select the **date**
   - Set **start time** and **end time** (e.g., `08:00-10:00`)
   - Enter **test name**
   - Set **required assistants** (how many students needed)
3. Click **"Add Test Shift"**

### Step 5: Set Monthly Contract Targets
1. In **"Monthly Contract Targets"** section
2. Set the **default monthly target** (usually 72 hours)
3. Click **"Apply to all students"**

### Step 6: Choose View Mode
1. **Single Month View** (default): Shows only the selected month
2. **3-Month View**: Shows current month plus previous and next months
   - Click **"3-Month View"** in the top header to toggle
   - Useful for seeing patterns across multiple months
   - Automatically generates schedules for all 3 months when you click **"Run Scheduler"**

---

## Running the Scheduler

### Step 1: Generate the Schedule
1. Click **"Run Scheduler"** in the top header
2. The system will:
   - Create shift slots for each day
   - Apply test shift requirements
   - Assign students based on availability and **weekly consistency**
   - Show progress in the algorithm logs

> **üí° Weekly Consistency**: The scheduler prioritizes students who already work the same weekday at the same time, creating predictable patterns. For example, if Alice works Monday 14:30-15:30 in Week 1, she'll be prioritized for Monday 14:30-15:30 in future weeks.

### Step 2: Review the Results
1. Check the calendar view for assigned shifts
2. Look for any empty shifts (showing "Click to add students")
3. Review the algorithm logs for any issues

### Step 3: Fill Empty Shifts
1. Click **"Fill Open/Close"** to prioritize opening and closing shifts
2. For remaining empty shifts, click on them to add students manually

### Step 4: Rebalance if Needed
1. Click **"Rebalance"** to improve fairness
2. This redistributes hours more evenly among students
3. You can run rebalance multiple times if needed

- **Visual indicators**: Overridden shifts show a üîß badge
- **Drag-and-drop works**: You can drag any student to any shift
- **Audit trail**: All admin overrides are logged with timestamps

### Visual Indicators
- **üîß Badge**: Appears on shifts that have been overridden
- **Orange border**: Admin-overridden shifts have a distinctive orange border
- **Pulsing animation**: Drop targets show a pulsing orange border when dragging

### Disabling Admin Override Mode
1. Click **"Disable Admin Mode"** in the top header
2. The button returns to normal color
3. Normal scheduling restrictions are restored

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "No shifts being filled"
- **Check student availability**: Make sure students have time slots that match the shift times
- **Check operational hours**: Ensure the facility is open during shift times
- **Check test conflicts**: Students can't work before tests or within 1 hour after

#### "Student shows as not available"
- **Check weekly schedule**: Student's availability must include the shift time
- **Check test dates**: Student might have a test on that day
- **Check hour limits**: Student might have reached weekly or monthly limits

#### "Cannot drag student"
- **Look for üîí icon**: This means the student isn't available at that time
- **Check conflicts**: Student might have overlapping shifts
- **Check capacity**: Shift might be full

#### "Algorithm logs show errors"
- **Check CSV format**: Make sure all required columns are present
- **Check date formats**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates
- **Check time formats**: Use HH:MM format for times (24-hour)

#### "3-Month View not showing data"
- **Check if schedules exist**: Make sure you've run the scheduler for the months you're viewing
- **Switch to single month**: Try single month view first to verify data exists
- **Check month range**: Ensure the months you're viewing have operational days
- **Run scheduler in 3-month mode**: Click "Run Scheduler" while in 3-month view to generate all months

### Getting Help
1. **Check algorithm logs**: Scroll down to see detailed information
2. **Use validation**: Click **"Validate"** to check for issues
3. **Save your work**: Use **"Save"** to backup your progress
4. **Load previous work**: Use **"Load"** to restore a backup
5. **Use Admin Override**: If you need to bypass restrictions, enable Admin Mode
6. **Check feedback messages**: Look for toast notifications that explain what happened
